Here is a summary of the research paper on integrating AI planning with natural language processing, aimed at the general public and AI enthusiasts/industry professionals:

This paper explores the integration of two powerful AI techniques - automated planning (AI planning) and natural language processing (NLP). AI planning focuses on building symbolic models and synthesizing plans to achieve goals based on those models. NLP, on the other hand, investigates interactions between intelligent agents and humans by processing and analyzing natural language data.  

The authors argue that combining these two approaches can lead to more explainable and lightweight AI systems. Large language models have made great strides in NLP, but they often lack transparency and struggle with complexity. Integrating AI planning techniques that capture logical relationships and rules can help make NLP models more interpretable.

Conversely, natural language texts contain implied rules and coherent narratives akin to the preconditions and effects modeled in AI planning. Extracting this structured knowledge from texts using NLP can inform the construction of more robust planning domain models.

The paper outlines five key areas where AI planning and NLP can effectively augment each other:
1) Planning-based text understanding 
2) Planning-based natural language processing tasks like generation and summarization
3) Enhancing explainability of AI systems
4) Enabling natural language human-robot interaction
5) Novel applications spanning various domains

By combining the explicit knowledge representation of AI planning with the ability of NLP to learn tacit knowledge from data, the authors posit that more capable and trustworthy AI systems can be developed. However, significant research is still needed to fully leverage this powerful combination of techniques.

The paper provides a comprehensive perspective on integratingAI planning and NLP, highlighting their synergies, current progress, and future potential for revolutionizing human-AI interaction and developing more transparent and robust AI assistants.
