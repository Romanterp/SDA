**Integrating AI Planning with Natural Language Processing: A Synthesis of Explicit and Tacit Knowledge**

In the rapidly advancing world of artificial intelligence, two significant domains—Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Automated Planning (AI Planning)—are beginning to converge, offering new pathways for enhancing human-computer interactions. This paper, authored by Kebing Jin and Hankz Hankui Zhuo, delves into the integration of these domains, presenting a nuanced exploration of how AI planning can complement NLP to overcome some of its inherent challenges and push the boundaries of what AI can achieve in understanding and generating human language.

### Abstract Overview

The primary objective of this research is to bridge the gap between NLP and AI Planning by harnessing their complementary strengths. While NLP excels at processing and analyzing vast amounts of unstructured natural language data, AI Planning focuses on creating explicit, structured plans that can transition from initial states to desired goals. By integrating these fields, the authors propose methods to enhance the explainability and efficiency of language models. The paper identifies five key areas where this integration proves beneficial: planning-based text understanding, natural language processing, explainability, human-robot interaction, and various practical applications. The findings suggest that combining the explicit knowledge from AI Planning with the tacit knowledge embedded in NLP models can lead to more robust and interpretable AI systems.

### Introduction and Background

Natural Language Processing has made significant strides in recent years, particularly with the development of large-scale language models capable of handling extensive corpora. However, these models often grapple with issues of complexity and explainability, making it difficult for humans to understand their decision-making processes. AI Planning, on the other hand, is adept at dealing with structured data, creating clear, rule-based plans that are easily interpretable. The integration of these fields leverages the strengths of both: the deep, often implicit learning capabilities of NLP and the explicit, rule-based approaches of AI Planning.

A practical example provided in the paper illustrates how AI Planning can enhance NLP tasks. Consider a recipe for making meatloaf. Humans can easily follow the steps and understand the sequence of actions. However, for an AI agent, translating these steps into coherent actions requires extracting and formalizing the underlying rules and sequences, a task well-suited to AI Planning. This structured approach can then guide the AI in generating valid and coherent plans or texts, much like creating an understandable recipe from abstract instructions.

### Key Insights and Implications

The research highlights several areas where integrating AI Planning with NLP yields significant advantages:

1. **Planning-Based Text Understanding**: This involves extracting actionable sequences from texts and learning domain-specific models. By applying planning algorithms, AI systems can better interpret and organize the information contained in natural language.

2. **Planning-Based Natural Language Processing**: Tasks such as text generation, summarization, and translation benefit from a structured approach where key elements are pre-planned. This method allows for the creation of coherent and contextually accurate outputs.

3. **Explainability**: AI Planning contributes to making NLP models more transparent by providing clear, rule-based explanations for their actions and decisions. This is crucial for applications where understanding the rationale behind AI decisions is essential.

4. **Human-Robot Interaction**: By translating natural language instructions into actionable plans, AI Planning enhances the ability of robots and intelligent agents to understand and execute complex commands, facilitating smoother interactions with humans.

5. **Applications**: The integration of these fields has vast potential in various practical applications, from improving navigation systems like Google Maps to advancing human-robot collaboration in industrial settings.

### Conclusion and Future Directions

The paper concludes that the intersection of AI Planning and NLP presents a fertile ground for future research, with the potential to significantly enhance the capabilities and understandability of AI systems. Despite the progress made, there remains a considerable gap in fully realizing the potential of this integration. Future research needs to focus on deepening our understanding of the implicit knowledge in texts and improving the ability to describe and solve complex planning problems.

Integrating AI Planning with NLP not only aids in the development of more coherent and context-aware AI but also promotes better communication between humans and intelligent agents. This promising combination of explicit and tacit knowledge stands to revolutionize how AI understands and interacts with the world, opening new avenues for innovation and application in the field of artificial intelligence.

By blending the structured, rule-based approaches of AI Planning with the nuanced, data-driven insights of NLP, researchers can create more transparent, efficient, and effective AI systems capable of navigating the complexities of human language and behavior.
