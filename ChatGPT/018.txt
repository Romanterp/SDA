In recent advancements of artificial intelligence, particularly in the realm of humanoid robotics, the ability to effectively communicate through non-verbal means such as sign language has emerged as a critical area of development. Traditional methods for teaching robotic agents to understand and express sign language have often relied on pre-programmed actions, limiting their flexibility and adaptability in real-world interactions. This gap motivated our research, which explores a novel approach: teaching artificial agents sign language through imitation learning from visual demonstrations.

Our methodology leverages computer vision techniques and deep learning to extract meaningful information from RGB videos of sign language gestures. By employing reinforcement learning algorithms, specifically Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), we enable these agents to replicate observed actions in a simulated environment without the need for additional specialized hardware. This approach not only enhances the agents' ability to learn sign language but also broadens their potential applications in contexts requiring human-robot interaction.

The study focuses on teaching a simulated humanoid American Sign Language (ASL), achieving successful imitation of five different signs involving upper body movements. This accomplishment underscores the practical viability of our method and its potential to enhance communication between robots and humans, particularly benefiting the deaf community by facilitating real-time sign language interpretation in educational and other settings.

In conclusion, while our research marks significant progress in robotic sign language acquisition from visual data, several challenges and opportunities for improvement remain. Future efforts could include expanding the range of signs replicated by enhancing joint flexibility and developing mechanisms to accelerate learning new signs based on prior experiences. Ultimately, transitioning our findings from simulation to real-world applications poses an exciting frontier, promising increased accessibility of sign language communication through advanced AI technologies.

This work not only addresses current limitations in robotic sign language capabilities but also underscores the broader societal impact of enabling more inclusive human-robot interactions, particularly for individuals with hearing impairments.
