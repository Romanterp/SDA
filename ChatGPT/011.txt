In the rapidly evolving field of artificial intelligence, aligning data points between different datasets—whether in machine learning or various scientific disciplines—is a fundamental challenge. This task falls under the umbrella of "optimal transport" (OT), a mathematical framework that has proven invaluable in aligning distributions and transforming data. Traditionally, solutions like the entropic OT (EOT) solver, which modifies classical OT problems with entropic regularization, have been popular due to their computational efficiency. However, these methods hinge critically on a hyperparameter, epsilon (ε), whose correct tuning is crucial yet difficult to achieve, often affecting the performance and accuracy of the solutions.

### Abstract: Main Goals and Findings

The study introduces a novel class of OT solvers, dubbed PROGOT, which addresses the limitations of traditional EOT solvers. The primary objective is to enhance the robustness and speed of OT computations, particularly for large datasets. PROGOT achieves this by breaking down the mass displacement process into discrete time steps, inspired by dynamic OT formulations. Through experimental validation, the research demonstrates that PROGOT not only matches but often surpasses existing EOT solvers and neural network-based approaches in both speed and reliability. Additionally, PROGOT is shown to provide statistically consistent estimates for OT maps, crucial for accurate data transformations.

### Introduction: Background and Purpose

Optimal transport theory has wide-ranging applications, from machine learning to natural sciences like biology and quantum chemistry. At its core, OT seeks to either find an optimal way to move data points from one distribution to another (solving the Monge problem) or to compute a matrix that describes the coupling between two distributions (the Kantorovitch problem). In practical scenarios involving large datasets, EOT has become a favored method due to its integration with the Sinkhorn algorithm, which simplifies and speeds up computations. Despite its popularity, setting the entropic regularization parameter ε remains a significant challenge. Incorrect tuning can lead to either biased or overly smooth results, hampering the utility of the EOT approach in real-world applications.

### Conclusion: Key Takeaways and Impact

PROGOT emerges as a superior alternative by incorporating dynamic parameter adjustments into the traditional OT framework. This new family of solvers dynamically schedules the entropic regularization and other parameters throughout the computation process, mitigating the common issues faced by static EOT solvers. As a result, PROGOT consistently delivers reliable and accurate OT maps and coupling matrices without the extensive trial and error usually needed for parameter tuning.

Key advantages of PROGOT include:
1. **Adaptability and Robustness:** It autonomously adjusts ε, reducing the risk of biased or suboptimal solutions.
2. **Performance:** PROGOT maintains or improves the speed of computation compared to traditional methods, crucial for handling large datasets.
3. **Accuracy:** It provides statistically consistent map estimates, ensuring dependable data transformations.

The broader implication of this work is significant for fields that rely on OT, offering a robust and efficient tool that can serve as a new standard for solving OT problems. As the demand for precise and scalable data alignment continues to grow, PROGOT stands out as a promising advancement, simplifying the deployment of OT solutions across diverse applications.

In essence, this research propels the field forward by not only addressing a long-standing challenge in optimal transport but also by providing a versatile tool that enhances both the efficiency and reliability of data alignment processes.
