In recent years, advancements in Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) have led to the development of models capable of generating text indistinguishable from human writing. This progress, while impressive, brings forth significant ethical, legal, and societal concerns. The study at hand addresses these issues by proposing a sophisticated AI detection model that can effectively distinguish between AI-generated and human-written text. Utilizing machine learning methods such as XGBoost (XGB) Classifier, Support Vector Machine (SVM), and the advanced BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) architecture, the research aims to provide a reliable solution to this growing challenge.

The paper begins by exploring the rapid evolution of AI language models, which are increasingly used for content generation in various sectors, including virtual assistance and automated customer support. However, as these models become more adept at mimicking human language, they pose risks such as the spread of misinformation and manipulation of public opinion. The core objective of the study is to develop a method to identify AI-generated content accurately, thus addressing the pressing need for transparency and accountability in digital communication.

In the methodology, the study rigorously tests several machine learning techniques to differentiate between AI and human text. The findings reveal that the BERT model significantly outperforms XGB and SVM, achieving a notable 93% accuracy in detecting AI-generated content, compared to 84% and 81% for XGB and SVM, respectively. BERTâ€™s superior performance is attributed to its ability to understand and analyze the context of words within sentences more effectively than its counterparts.

The conclusion emphasizes BERT's potential as the leading solution for AI text detection, recognizing its advanced capabilities in handling the complexities of AI-generated language. However, the study also acknowledges the need for continuous refinement of these detection tools to keep pace with the rapid advancements in AI technology. It calls for a broader dialogue on the ethical implications of AI in content creation, advocating for responsible use and development of these technologies to mitigate risks associated with their misuse.

By weaving together these insights, the research underscores the dual role of AI in both advancing human capabilities and presenting new challenges. It highlights the importance of developing robust detection frameworks to ensure ethical and responsible integration of AI in society.
