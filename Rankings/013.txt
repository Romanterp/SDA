Ranking:
1. ChatGPT
2. Gemini
3. Claude


ChatGPT stands out for its clear, coherent, and insightful narrative, making it the most effective summary for a general audience. Gemini is strong in its clarity and relevance but could benefit from more detail on the technical methods and their impact. Claude provides a thorough technical overview but lacks the balance needed for accessibility to non-experts and could improve in conciseness and practical insight.
