3. Claude

ChatGPT excels due to its comprehensive coverage of the research paper's objectives, methods, findings, and future directions. It provides a detailed yet clear narrative that is both insightful and accessible.
Gemini offers a concise and accessible summary, well-suited for a general audience, but it lacks the depth and structured presentation of the full research context compared to Response 2.
Claude presents the research effectively with a focus on implications, but it does not integrate the methodological and background details as cohesively as Response 2.
