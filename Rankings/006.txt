Ranking:

1. ChatGPT
2. Gemini
3. Claude

ChatGPT excels in creating a well-rounded, accessible, and engaging narrative that integrates key points from the research paper. It effectively balances detail and readability, making it the most compelling summary for the general public. Gemini provides a clear and concise overview but lacks the depth and seamless flow of ChatGPT. Claude is accurate and methodical but lacks the narrative cohesion and engaging style needed to fully resonate with a broader audience.
