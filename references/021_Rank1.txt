Evaluation benchmarks play a crucial role in assessing the capabilities of large language models (LLMs) and driving progress in natural language processing. However, the variance in these benchmarks, which determines whether differences in performance are meaningful, has rarely been quantified. This research paper aims to address this issue by defining and measuring various metrics to assess the variance in evaluation benchmarks.

The abstract outlines the main objectives, methods, and findings of the study. The researchers measured seed variance across initializations, monotonicity during training, and other factors contributing to benchmark variance. They studied a large number of models, both publicly available and those pretrained from scratch, to provide empirical estimates for these variance metrics. The findings suggest that simple changes, such as framing choice tasks as completion tasks, can often reduce variance for smaller-scale models. However, more involved methods inspired by human testing literature, like item analysis and item response theory, struggled to meaningfully reduce variance.

The introduction provides background information and explains the purpose of the study. It highlights the importance of evaluation benchmarks in claiming progress and guiding model development decisions. However, the authors note that benchmark scores are often regarded as one-dimensional numbers, and statistical significance values are rarely reported. This lack of consideration for variance muddles the power of evaluation datasets and challenges reliable comparisons during model development.

In the conclusion, the authors emphasize the increasing importance of assessing language model capabilities as these models become more prevalent. They highlight the key takeaways from their work, including quantifying evaluation benchmark variance across various settings and metrics. While methods from human standardised testing proved ineffective, the researchers demonstrated that LLM-specific techniques, such as using continuous metrics or cloze-formatted tasks, can improve the signal-to-noise ratio in evaluations.

The study's broader impact lies in its potential to spur future work on reducing variance in evaluation benchmarks and serve as an empirical guide for model practitioners when comparing models and assessing performance. By quantifying variance and exploring techniques to mitigate it, this research contributes to the ongoing efforts to reliably measure and compare the capabilities of large language models, ultimately driving progress in natural language processing.
