In this research paper, the focus is on advancing maritime surveillance through deep learning models applied to Automatic Identification System (AIS) data. The study introduces a methodology employing deep Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) models, specifically a bidirectional GRU architecture, for analyzing and predicting ships' motion patterns. These models are trained to reconstruct observed trajectories and detect anomalies based on reconstruction errors.

The introduction underscores the critical need for anomaly detection in maritime operations to enhance safety and security by identifying potential risks early. AIS, originally designed for navigation safety, now serves multiple purposes including vessel traffic management and maritime domain awareness. The vast amount of data it generates necessitates advanced deep learning techniques capable of handling complex temporal dynamics inherent in ship motion patterns.

The conclusion highlights the significant findings of the study. By employing deep RNNs, particularly bidirectional GRUs, the research demonstrates superior performance in capturing maritime data's temporal dynamics and detecting anomalies effectively. The approach avoids overfitting by prioritizing genuine anomaly detection over data idiosyncrasies, thus ensuring robust surveillance capabilities. The study concludes by emphasizing the broader implications for maritime safety and security, indicating a promising future for integrating deep learning with AIS data analysis to further enhance surveillance capabilities.

Overall, this research provides a foundational contribution to the field, laying the groundwork for future advancements in maritime anomaly detection through innovative applications of deep learning technologies.
