ABSTRACT Natural Language Processing (NLP) is an important branch of artificial intelligence
that studies how to enable computers to understand, process, and generate human language. Text
classification is a fundamental task in NLP, which aims to classify text into different predefined
categories. Text classification is the most basic and classic task in natural language processing, and most
of the tasks in natural language processing can be regarded as classification tasks. In recent years, deep
learning has achieved great success in many research fields, and today, it has also become a standard
technology in the field of NLP, which is widely integrated into text classification tasks. Unlike numbers
and images, text processing emphasizes fine-grained processing ability. Traditional text classification
methods generally require preprocessing the input model's text data. Additionally, they also need to
obtain good sample features through manual annotation and then use classical machine learning
algorithms for classification. Therefore, this paper analyzes the application status of deep learning in the
three core tasks of NLP (including text representation, word order modeling, and knowledge
representation). This content explores the improvement and synergy achieved through natural language
processing in the context of text classification, while also taking into account the challenges posed by
adversarial techniques in text generation, text classification, and semantic parsing. An empirical study on
text classification tasks demonstrates the effectiveness of interactive integration training, particularly in
conjunction with TextCNN, highlighting the significance of these advancements in text classification
augmentation and enhancement.

Introduction
Natural language processing (NLP), an important branch of artificial intelligence, has
developed rapidly in recent years, driven by deep learning. Deep neural networks, such as
recurrent neural networks (RNNS) and convolutional neural networks (CNNS), have
demonstrated excellent performance in semantic understanding, speech recognition and machine
translation, but they also face security risks such as anti-sample and poison attacks. In many
SPIE Proceedings Publications
cases, the diversity, complexity and distribution of information in text form makes traditional
manual analysis methods ineffective, forcing people to look for new solutions. Intelligence texts
cover a wide range of media and sources, including news reports, spy reports, battlefield reports,
government documents, social media posts and more. These texts can contain information from
all parts of the world and at all times, making them highly timely and valuable. However, this
diversity also presents significant challenges, as texts from different sources may use different
formats, languages and phrases, leading to fragmentation of information and increased difficulty
in analysis. In addition, intelligence texts themselves are often highly specialised, containing a
large number of technical terms, acronyms and domain-specific languages, which places higher
professional demands on analysts and therefore requires a more intelligent and efficient approach
to this problem.
Traditional text classification methods generally need to pre-process the text data of the
input model, in addition to obtaining good sample features through manual annotation, and then
use classical machine learning algorithms to classify them. Similar methods include Naive Bayes
(NB), K-Nearest Neighbour (KNN), Support Vector Machine (SVM), etc. The level of feature
extraction has an even greater impact on text classification than on image classification, and
feature engineering in text classification is often time consuming and computationally expensive.
After 2010, the method of text classification gradually shifted to deep learning model. Deep
learning applied to text classification maps feature engineering directly to the output by learning
a series of nonlinear transformation patterns, thus integrating feature engineering into the process
of model fitting, and has achieved great success once applied. Therefore, this paper delves into
the current state of applying deep learning to the fundamental tasks of Natural Language
Processing (NLP), which encompass text representation, word order modeling, and knowledge
representation. It further explores strategies for enhancing natural language processing
technology, specifically through the utilization of text classification algorithms, in response to
the challenges posed by attack methodologies in text generation, text classification, and semantic
parsing. The effectiveness of an integrated interactive training approach is corroborated through
empirical studies conducted on text classification tasks. This comprehensive analysis integrates
insights from "Classification Augmentation and Synergy through TextCNN and Natural
Language Processing," underscoring the significance of these advancements in the NLP field.

Conclusion
This paper discusses in detail the application of deep learning in natural language
processing, especially in the field of text classification. Through the application of TextCNN and
other models, it successfully realises the efficient processing of core tasks such as sentiment
analysis. Deep learning has brought significant improvements to NLP technology, making the
task of processing text data more flexible and efficient. The experimental results show that
TextCNN and other models perform well in text classification tasks, especially under the pre-
trained word embeddedness, and achieve satisfactory performance. In addition, this paper also
focuses on the technical challenges of text generation, text classification and semantic parsing,
and proposes an integrated interactive training method to effectively address these challenges,
which provides an important reference for further research and application in the field of NLP.
As one of the most important tasks in natural language processing, text classification is
constantly evolving and expanding. In the future, with the continuous development and
improvement of deep learning technology, text classification will bring more opportunities and
challenges. Some of these future directions are
1. Multimodal text classification: Combining text with multimodal information such as
images and audio for classification, so that text classification can better meet the processing
needs of multimedia content. 
2. Cross-lingual text classification: Develop a text classification model that can handle
multiple languages, and promote the analysis of multilingual social media and international
information.
3. Continuous learning: Develop text classification models that can continuously learn and
adapt to new data and domains to cope with the changing information environment.
4. Privacy protection: Strengthen the protection of user privacy in text classification to
prevent the misuse of personal information.
In summary, text classification has a wide range of application prospects in natural language
processing, which is not only of great value in public opinion analysis, information retrieval and
other fields, but also plays an important role in everyday life, such as social media and intelligent
assistants. As technology continues to advance, we can expect text classification to play a greater
role in improving natural language processing techniques and solving practical pro
