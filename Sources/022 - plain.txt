ABSTRACT
A methodology based on deep recurrent models for maritime surveil-
lance, over publicly available Automatic Identification System (AIS)
data, is presented in this paper. The setup employs a deep Recurrent
Neural Network (RNN)-based model, for encoding and reconstruct-
ing the observed ships’ motion patterns. Our approach is based
on a thresholding mechanism, over the calculated errors between
observed and reconstructed motion patterns of maritime vessels.
Specifically, a deep-learning framework, i.e. an encoder-decoder ar-
chitecture, is trained using the observed motion patterns, enabling
the models to learn and predict the expected trajectory, which will
be compared to the effective ones. Our models, particularly the
bidirectional GRU with recurrent dropouts, showcased superior
performance in capturing the temporal dynamics of maritime data,
illustrating the potential of deep learning to enhance maritime
surveillance capabilities. Our work lays a solid foundation for fu-
ture research in this domain, highlighting a path toward improved
maritime safety through the innovative application of technology.

1 INTRODUCTION
In the maritime domain the creation and utilization of reliable mech-
anisms for anomaly detection is crucial [12]. Nowadays, the term
anomaly detection employs much more than just deviations from a
predifined set of rules. Operators are interested in early indications
of potential risks, such as environmental hazards, navigational er-
rors, or even covert suspicious activities. These subtle changes in
trajectories, if promptly detected, could significantly bolster mar-
itime security, aid in risk mitigation, and provide timely insights
to law enforcement authorities. As such, the utilization of deep
learning approaches, based on various data sources, is an active
research field [13].
The Automatic Identification System (AIS) is a widely used track-
ing system in the maritime industry that enables vessels to au-
tomatically broadcast information about their identity, position,
speed, and other relevant information [7 ]. AIS was originally devel-
oped to enhance maritime safety and navigation, but it also serves
other purposes such as vessel traffic management, maritime domain
awareness, and search and rescue operations. As such, it serves

as an extremely useful data source for any analysis that involves
outliers detection.
The amount of data provided by AIS dictates the utilization of
deep learning approaches, which are capable of capturing complex
dynamics in maritime environments [ 9]. Furthermore, since we are
handling sequences of information, i.e. ships motion patterns as
time series, RNN architectures should be considered. In this study,
we employ a deep-learning RNN-based approach for encoding and
reconstructing the observed ships’ motion patterns. The outlier de-
tection mechanisms are based on the reconstruction errors between
the model and the observed values.

6 CONCLUSIONS
In conclusion, our study advances the field of maritime navigation
anomaly detection by leveraging deep learning models to analyze
AIS data from MarineCadastre. Through a meticulous experimen-
tal setup employing RNNs, including SimpleRNN and GRU, we
have demonstrated the effectiveness of different architectures in
identifying navigational anomalies. Our models, particularly the
bidirectional GRU with recurrent dropouts, showcased superior
performance in capturing the temporal dynamics of maritime data,
illustrating the potential of deep learning to enhance maritime
surveillance.
Our deliberate approach to model training, ensuring not to over-
fit to outliers, has underscored the importance of a balanced method-
ology that prioritizes the detection of genuine anomalies over mem-
orizing data idiosyncrasies. This strategy, combined with our thor-
ough analysis, has notably identified certain vessels that frequently
appear as outliers, underscoring the recurrent nature of specific
anomalies within the maritime domain.
Moving forward, the integration of sophisticated deep learning
techniques with an exhaustive analysis of AIS data is poised to
significantly enhance maritime surveillance capabilities. Our work
lays a solid foundation for future research in this domain, highlight-
ing a path toward improved maritime safety through the innovative
application of technology. This research marks an important mile-
stone in the evolution of anomaly detection in maritime navigation,
paving the way for a safer and more secure maritime environment.
