Abstract—This paper presents a novel anomaly detection
methodology termed Statistical Aggregated Anomaly Detection
(SAAD). The SAAD approach integrates advanced statistical
techniques with machine learning, and its efficacy is demon-
strated through validation on real sensor data from a Hardware-
in-the-Loop (HIL) environment within the automotive domain.
The key innovation of SAAD lies in its ability to significantly
enhance the accuracy and robustness of anomaly detection when
combined with Fully Connected Networks (FCNs) augmented by
dropout layers. Comprehensive experimental evaluations indicate
that the standalone statistical method achieves an accuracy
of 72.1%, whereas the deep learning model alone attains an
accuracy of 71.5%. In contrast, the aggregated method achieves
a superior accuracy of 88.3% and an F1 score of 0.921, thereby
outperforming the individual models. These results underscore
the effectiveness of SAAD, demonstrating its potential for broad
application in various domains, including automotive systems.

I. INTRODUCTION
Anomaly detection is a critical task in various fields, partic-
ularly in the automotive industry, where it plays a significant
role in ensuring the reliability and safety of systems. With
the advent of advanced machine learning (ML) techniques,
anomaly detection has seen substantial improvements in ac-
curacy and efficiency. Machine learning models, especially
deep learning architectures, have shown promising results in
identifying abnormal patterns that could indicate potential
faults or cyber-attacks in automotive systems [1], [2].
In the context of automotive systems, anomaly detection
is crucial for maintaining the operational integrity of both
traditional and autonomous vehicles. Autonomous vehicles, in
particular, rely heavily on a multitude of sensors to navigate
and operate safely. These sensors provide continuous streams
of data that need to be monitored in real-time for any signs
of anomalies that could compromise the vehicle’s safety and
functionality [3], [4]. Machine learning models have been
employed to analyze these data streams, allowing for the
early detection of issues and the implementation of corrective
actions before any adverse events occur [5].
To validate and verify the performance of control sys-
tems under real-time conditions, Hardware-in-the-Loop (HIL)
testing is an essential technique used in the industry. HIL
testing involves integrating actual hardware components with
simulated environments, providing a highly controlled and re-
peatable setting to assess the behavior of automotive systems.
This method is particularly beneficial for anomaly detection,
as it allows for the collection of high-fidelity data that can
be used to train and test machine learning models under
various scenarios [6]. Additionally, HIL testing helps mitigate
the common issue of imbalanced data in anomaly detection
datasets by enabling the generation of synthetic data to balance
the dataset.
Evaluating anomaly detection algorithms often requires
specific metrics tailored for time series data, as classical
precision and recall metrics may not capture the nuanced
performance characteristics required for detecting anomalies
in continuous data streams [7]. Advanced evaluation metrics
consider the duration and timing of anomalies, providing a
more robust assessment of an algorithm’s performance in real-
world conditions.
Recent studies have explored various machine learning
approaches for anomaly detection in different domains. For
instance, [8] utilized explainable random forests to detect
anomalies in oil wells, achieving high accuracy and demon-
strating the effectiveness of explainable AI in critical applica-
tions. Another study [9] proposed a clustered deep one-class
classification model for detecting anomalies in cyber-physical
systems, showing significant performance improvements over
traditional models. A survey on anomaly detection in IoT
time-series data highlighted the unique challenges and pro-
posed solutions for implementing these techniques in rapidly
expanding fields like the Internet of Things [10]. Additionally,
a comprehensive review on outlier detection in time series data
provided a structured overview of unsupervised techniques and
their applications [11]. The integration of ML in the industry has also yielded
impressive results in structural health monitoring [12], [13].
Building on these advancements, recent studies have expanded
the field towards hybrid-assisted models that leverage logical
rules. These neuro-symbolic approaches combine deep learn-
ing with knowledge-based systems to enhance performance.
Research has shown that these hybrid models, which incor-
porate domain-specific knowledge, significantly outperform
standard deep learning models by providing more accurate
and explainable results [14], [15]. Additionally, innovative
methods such as GraphLIME have demonstrated significant
improvements in model interpretability and performance in
predictive tasks, further showcasing the potential of combining
explainable AI techniques with deep learning [16]. The inter-
pretability aspect is highly valuable, as seen in [17], where
the insights were used to understand and solve the feature
distribution issue that occurred with the generated pseudo-
features. A comprehensive comparison in [18] highlights both
the advantages of hybrid models and the challenges of creating
and scaling them. These hybrid approaches, which synergize
complementary components, form the cornerstone of the con-
ceptual framework presented in this paper.
In this paper, we introduce Statistical Aggregated Anomaly
Detection (SAAD), a novel anomaly detection method de-
signed to effectively integrate statistical techniques for out-
lier detection with the performance of supervised machine
learning models. Our approach specifically aims to enhance
the accuracy and robustness of Fully Connected Networks
(FCNs) in anomaly detection tasks. Utilizing real-world data
collected from Hardware-in-the-Loop (HIL) environments, we
demonstrate the effectiveness of SAAD in identifying anoma-
lies with high precision and recall. Additionally, we illustrate
how our statistical method can augment the performance of
FCNs, rendering them more reliable for real-time applications
in automotive systems
VI. CONCLUSION
In this paper, we introduced SAAD, a novel statistical
anomaly detection method with promising results for automo-
tive systems, validated through extensive testing using real-
world data collected from a Hardware-in-the-Loop (HIL) en-
vironment. Our main contribution is merging a novel statistical
method with deep learning, taking the best of both approaches
and achieving higher accuracy with the joint operation than
with standalone models.
The results of our experiments demonstrate the efficacy
of our proposed method. The standalone statistical method
achieved an accuracy of 72.1% on the testing data, while the
deep learning model alone provided an accuracy of 71.5%.
When combined, the aggregated results yielded an accuracy
of up to 88.3% and an F1 score of 0.921.
The integration of statistical techniques with machine learn-
ing models highlights the potential for enhancing existing
anomaly detection frameworks, making them more reliable
and effective in real-world applications.
Future work will focus on further refining the statistical
method, exploring adaptive threshold techniques for multi-
variate time series data, and expanding the application scope
to other critical automotive systems. This will help improve
the robustness and scalability of our approach, ensuring its
effectiveness across diverse and complex scenarios, while also
extending its applicability beyond automotive systems.
