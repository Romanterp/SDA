Abstract
This paper introduces Fortune Analytics Language Model (FALM). FALM empowers
users with direct access to comprehensive business analysis, including market
trends, company performance metrics, and expert insights. Unlike generic LLMs,
FALM leverages a curated knowledge base built from professional journalism, en-
abling it to deliver precise and in-depth answers to intricate business questions.
Users can further leverage natural language queries to directly visualize financial
data, generating insightful charts and graphs to understand trends across diverse
business sectors clearly. FALM fosters user trust and ensures output accuracy
through three novel methods: 1) Time-aware reasoning guarantees accurate event
registration and prioritizes recent updates. 2) Thematic trend analysis explicitly
examines topic evolution over time, providing insights into emerging business
landscapes. 3) Content referencing and task decomposition enhance answer fidelity
and data visualization accuracy. We conduct both automated and human evalua-
tions, demonstrating FALM’s significant performance improvements over baseline
methods while prioritizing responsible AI practices. These benchmarks establish
FALM as a cutting-edge LLM in the business and media domains, with exceptional
accuracy and trustworthiness.
1 Introduction
The ever-shifting business landscape necessitates powerful tools for staying ahead. While large
language models (LLMs) have shown promise in analyzing vast datasets and generating valuable
insights for market analysts [Wu et al., 2023], they haven’t yet reached the full potential of state-of-
the-art general-purpose LLMs [Achiam et al., 2023, Team et al., 2023, Jiang et al., 2024, Touvron
et al., 2023]. This gap stems from the unique challenge of integrating diverse data sources and
modalities within the business domain, while ensuring exceptional accuracy and fidelity for real-
world applications.
This paper introduces Fortune Analytics Language Model (FALM), a business-centric AI system
designed specifically for the business and media domain. We leverage the rich heritage of Fortune
Media, a globally renowned publication known for its in-depth feature articles spanning over 95
years. This vast knowledge base, created by professional journalists, forms the foundation for FALM’s
training data. By focusing on the business and media domain, FALM empowers users with intuitive
and insightful business analysis through two core functionalities:
• Business-Centric Question Answering: FALM leverages diverse data sources, including news
articles, video interviews, ranking lists, financial metrics, and business leader profiles, to answer
complex questions about the ever-evolving business landscape. It identifies trends across various
topics, from market fluctuations to industry leadership shifts, and offers its analysis based
on financial indicators. For instance, if a user inquires, “How has the interest in sustainable
consumption among younger consumers affected purchasing patterns?” FALM will utilize recent
news articles, reports, and video interviews to generate a thorough and precise analysis.
• Data Visualization: FALM’s capabilities extend beyond question answering. Users can directly
visualize financial data through natural language queries and ask for charts or graphs to gain a
more intuitive understanding of complex financial trends. For instance, a user may ask: “Can you
show me a graph comparing the revenue of the top 10 companies over the last decade?” FALM
would interpret the request and generate an easy-to-understand chart illustrating the revenue of
the top performers over the past ten years.
However, developing such a tool presents its challenges. While LLMs have revolutionized many
domains [Saab et al., 2024, George and George, 2023, Webersinke et al., 2021, Chen and Li, 2024],
ensuring the correctness and consistency of LLM-generated outputs, especially for complex business
reasoning tasks, remains an active area of research. This paper addresses three key challenges in
developing business-centric AI systems, focusing on real-world user requirements.
Time-Aware Reasoning Value of business data is often contingent on its timeliness, and accurate
contextualization of events necessitates a robust anchoring to relevant temporal coordinates. For
instance, if a 2020 news article references an event from "last year," the system should interpret "last
year" as 2019, not 2023. Furthermore, when users pose queries on a certain topic, the model should
prioritize presenting the most current news and information. FALM integrates an understanding of
time into the decision-making processes through instruction finetuning. As a result, the model is able
to maintain relevance, reliability, and accuracy in its responses, enhancing user satisfaction and trust.
Thematic Modeling for Trend Analysis Business-related queries encompass a diverse range of
current affairs, corporate activities, social issues, as well as market and industry trends reported by
journalists. It is important for the model to comprehend the chronological progression of various
topics or "themes" over time in order to appropriately answer questions such as “How has AI evolved
in the last five years?” FALM explicitly models trends across several temporal scales (month, quarter,
year, multi-year) and provides a comprehensive view of how a particular topic has evolved over time,
taking into account short-term fluctuations as well as long-term trends.
Accuracy and Trust Accuracy is critical when it comes to business and financial data. As
probabilistic models, LLMs introduce inherent scholastic behaviors, making precise control of
accuracy challenging. We address accuracy through three main approaches:
• Task Decomposition: We decompose many of the challenging tasks into stages in order to achieve
control over accuracy. For example, in the financial data visualization task, we decompose char
generation into code generation, followed by an execution phrase using a financial spreadsheet.
This ensures data fidelity, as the generated code leverages verified financial metrics as to produce
the visualizations.
• Knowledge Boundaries: Unlike general-purpose LLMs, our model responds to queries within a
predefined business domain.. Suppose a question falls outside the training data’s coverage; in
that case, our model generates a "rejection response" that declares that the inquired topic lies
outside of its designed domain instead of potentially generating ungrounded outputs.
• Content Referencing: We integrated a content referencing system into the interface to provide
users with insights into the model’s reasoning process. This feature offers users insight into
the model’s decision-making process by providing hyperlinks within the generated text or in
summarized articles displayed alongside the responses.
Safety is of paramount importance to AI systems. We employ a multi-layered approach to ensure the
model generates safe and reliable outputs:
• Corpus guardrail: To ensure the reliability of the information that FALM generates, we implement
a multi-layered corpus guardrail system during the data preparation process to mitigate bias and
protect privacy.
• Safety alignment: This process involves training the model on a curated dataset with unsafe
or misleading prompts. By exposing FALM to these questions, the model learns to identify and
reject these harmful queries at inference time.
• Deployment guardrail: Even after training, it is crucial to maintain safeguards against potential
risks during deployment. We implement robust deployment guardrails to ensure the system
operates safely and protects user privacy.
• Continuous Human Feedback: During the development process, we have continuously collected
user feedback via surveys and testing sessions. This feedback process allows us to identify and
rectify potential safety concerns early on, enabling us to constantly refine the model and ensure
it operates within safe boundaries.
In the following sections, we will describe our training data, business-centric question-answering
capabilities, data visualization techniques, the content reference system, safety guardrails, and
system designs. We will also present evaluation benchmarks to assess the performance of each FALM
components.
