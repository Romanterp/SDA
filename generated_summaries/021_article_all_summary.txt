Large language models (LLMs) are crucial tools in natural language processing, but their evaluation benchmarks have rarely been quantified. This study aimed to address this gap by defining and measuring various metrics to assess the variance in evaluation benchmarks. The researchers found that simple changes, such as framing choice tasks as completion tasks, can often reduce variance for smaller-scale models. However, more involved methods inspired by human testing literature, like item analysis and item response theory, struggled to meaningfully reduce variance.

The study highlights the importance of nuanced evaluation methodologies beyond simplistic performance scores, emphasizing the need for tailored approaches that account for LLM-specific intricacies. The findings suggest that LLM-specific techniques, such as using continuous metrics or cloze-formatted tasks, can improve the signal-to-noise ratio in evaluations.

In conclusion, the research contributes to the ongoing efforts to reliably measure and compare the capabilities of large language models, ultimately driving progress in natural language processing. By quantifying variance and exploring techniques to mitigate it, this study encourages a more nuanced approach to benchmarking that accounts for the unique challenges and opportunities presented by large language models in contemporary AI research.
