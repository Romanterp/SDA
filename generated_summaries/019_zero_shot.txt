The article discusses the advancements in AI for autonomous driving, specifically focusing on motion forecasting. The authors propose a modular approach, departing from the current trend of end-to-end training, to improve the forecasting performance. The approach involves individual training of detection, tracking, and forecasting modules, followed by consecutive finetuning steps to integrate the modules better and alleviate compounding errors.

The authors begin by providing background information on the importance of accurate scene understanding in autonomous driving, highlighting the need for detecting, tracking, and forecasting the behavior of agents in the scene. They then introduce the concept of end-to-end training, where detection, tracking, and forecasting tasks are tackled jointly in a pipeline, and discuss the limitations of this approach.

The authors' modular approach is based on the idea of integrating finetuning strategies to significantly outperform end-to-end-trained counterparts. They use BEVFusion for detection, AB3DMOT for tracking, and MTR for forecasting, and work on integrating all three into an end-to-end forecasting pipeline. The authors also discuss the importance of pretraining the detection and forecasting modules individually with curated data and the need for a post-processing step to account for the absence of static objects in the conventional motion forecasting pretraining.

The authors' solution, Valeo4Cast, ranks first in the Argoverse 2 end-to-end Forecasting Challenge 2024, surpassing forecasting results by +17.1 points over last year's winner and by +13.3 points over this year's runner-up. The authors conclude that their modular approach has the benefit of requiring limited resources, greatly improving the performances of downstream blocks, and opening the possibility of updating/upgrading a block without retraining all the upstream components.
