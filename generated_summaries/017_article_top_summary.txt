The paper introduces OpenCapBench, a unified benchmark that evaluates pose estimation models under physiological constraints using kinematic metrics derived from musculoskeletal modeling software. The authors also present SynthPose, a novel approach to fine-tuning pre-trained 2D pose estimation models using synthetic data.

The study highlights the limitations of current pose estimation benchmarks, which often prioritize metrics like Mean Per Joint Position Error and Percentage of Correct Keypoints, without considering the nuances of kinematic and physiological correctness. OpenCapBench addresses this challenge by providing a comprehensive evaluation framework that assesses the accuracy of existing pose estimation models and identifies areas for improvement.

SynthPose, on the other hand, demonstrates the potential of fine-tuning pre-trained models using synthetic data to improve joint angle prediction. This approach shows a significant reduction in Root Mean Squared Error for key biomechanically-relevant joints, highlighting the importance of dense keypoint prediction for accurate biomechanical analysis.

The authors acknowledge the limitations of the current dataset, which lacks diversity across subjects, environments, and activities. Future work aims to expand the benchmark to encompass upper body kinematics and integrate additional diverse datasets to enhance its relevance in clinical and research settings.

Overall, the research emphasizes the potential of AI in transforming human movement analysis and advocates for a collaborative approach to refining pose estimation models. The open-source nature of OpenCapBench encourages community engagement and further advancements in computer vision and kinematic analysis.
