The paper introduces OpenCapBench, a unified benchmark that bridges the gap between computer vision and biomechanics. The goal is to enable more accurate analysis of human movement and kinematics. Current pose estimation models use sparse keypoints, which are insufficient for biomechanical analysis. The research proposes SynthPose, a method that uses synthetic data to refine pre-trained pose estimation models, resulting in more accurate joint angle prediction.

The introduction highlights the importance of kinematic analysis in biomechanics and the limitations of current pose estimation models. Traditional methods require specialized laboratories and expertise, making it challenging to conduct large-scale studies. Computer vision techniques, on the other hand, focus on predicting human movement from videos but lack the specificity required for biomechanical research.

The paper presents OpenCapBench, a benchmark that evaluates pose estimation models under physiological constraints using kinematic metrics derived from musculoskeletal modeling software. The benchmark demonstrates that current pose estimation models use keypoints that are too sparse for accurate biomechanical analysis. SynthPose is introduced as a method to fine-tune pre-trained pose estimation models using synthetic data, resulting in a twofold reduction in average joint angle errors.

The conclusion emphasizes the significance of OpenCapBench and SynthPose in bridging the gap between computer vision and biomechanics. The research highlights the potential for improved healthcare outcomes through enhanced biomechanical understanding and intervention strategies. The open-source nature of OpenCapBench encourages community engagement and further advancements in computer vision and kinematic analysis.

Overall, this research paves the way for more accurate analysis of human movement and kinematics, with potential applications in healthcare, sports, and other fields. By integrating biomechanics and computer vision, the study aims to drive simultaneous advances in both areas, ultimately improving human health outcomes.
