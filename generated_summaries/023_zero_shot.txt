The research paper presents an end-to-end prototype, TalkTuner, which aims to make conversational AI systems more transparent by providing users with real-time insights into the internal state of the system. The prototype is built on top of an open-source large language model, LLaMa2Chat-13B, and incorporates interpretability techniques to identify and display internal representations of user characteristics, such as age, gender, education level, and socioeconomic status.

The paper begins by highlighting the limitations of conversational AI systems, particularly their lack of transparency, which can lead to concerns around bias and truthfulness. The authors argue that surfacing and providing control over the factors that underlie the system's behavior can benefit users. To test this hypothesis, they created a visual dashboard interface that displays information about the system's internal representation of the user, allowing users to modify the system's internal model of themselves.

The study found that users appreciated the dashboard, which provided insights into chatbot responses, raised user awareness of biased behavior, and gave them controls to help explore and mitigate those biases. The results suggest that users can benefit from increased transparency in AI systems, and that this transparency can lead to changes in users' attitudes and mental models of AI.

The paper concludes by highlighting the broader implications of this work, including the potential for future designs to generalize beyond the four user attributes focused on in this study, and the need to consider privacy concerns and user experience in future development. The authors also identify areas for future research, such as understanding gender differences in the experience of using the dashboard and exploring equivalents for voice-based or video-based systems.

Overall, the paper presents a compelling case for the importance of transparency in AI systems, and demonstrates the potential for design and machine learning research to work together to create more user-centric and accessible AI interfaces. By providing users with insights into the internal state of the system, the TalkTuner prototype offers a promising approach to increasing transparency and mitigating bias in conversational AI systems.
