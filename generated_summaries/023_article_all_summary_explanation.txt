Conversational AI systems, such as chatbots, have become increasingly popular, with over 100 million users worldwide. However, these systems lack transparency, making it difficult for users to understand why they receive certain responses. This lack of transparency raises concerns about potential biases and the truthfulness of the system's outputs.

To address this issue, researchers have developed an end-to-end prototype that connects interpretability techniques with user experience design. This prototype, called TalkTuner, provides a dashboard that displays the internal state of the chatbot, including its "user model" â€“ an internal representation of the user's characteristics, such as age, gender, education level, and socioeconomic status.

The researchers conducted a user study to test the effectiveness of TalkTuner. The results showed that users appreciated the dashboard, which provided insights into chatbot responses, raised user awareness of biased behavior, and gave them control to explore and mitigate those biases. The study also revealed that users uncovered subtle types of biases that the researchers did not anticipate, highlighting the value of user research in interpretability.

The researchers conclude that their end-to-end prototype provides evidence for a pathway toward more transparent and instrumented AI systems. They emphasize the importance of user research in interpretability, as it can uncover biases and provide insights into user experiences. The prototype also raises questions around privacy, given the availability of the internal model, and the need for further investigation into user experience and design.

The broader implications of this research are significant, as it has the potential to make AI systems safer and more effective. The researchers believe that their design pathway can lead to a world where AI systems become more transparent and instrumented, allowing users to understand and control the internal workings of the system. This could have far-reaching consequences for the development of AI systems and their integration into our daily lives.
