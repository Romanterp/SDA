The study aims to bridge the gap between the fields of computer vision and biomechanics by developing a unified benchmark for assessing human pose estimation. The authors introduce OpenCapBench, a benchmark that evaluates pose estimation models under physiological constraints, and SynthPose, a novel method that uses synthetic data to fine-tune pre-trained pose estimation models for accurate kinematic analysis.

The researchers highlight the importance of kinematic metrics in biomechanics, which are often neglected in pose estimation benchmarks. They demonstrate that current pose estimation models use keypoints that are too sparse for accurate biomechanics analysis, leading to large errors in joint angles. To address this challenge, the authors introduce SynthPose, which enables the fine-tuning of pre-trained 2D human pose models to predict a denser set of keypoints for accurate kinematic analysis.

The study also emphasizes the need for improved benchmarks and metrics in pose estimation, which can benefit both fields. The authors demonstrate that OpenCapBench can reduce joint angle errors by up to fourfold and improve the performance of pose estimation models. They also highlight the potential of OpenCapBench to integrate with other pose estimation tasks, such as 3D keypoint estimation and temporal predictions.

The authors conclude that their work aims to drive simultaneous advances in both computer vision and biomechanics, enabling the development of more accurate and realistic pose estimation models that can improve human movement analysis and human health outcomes. They envision a future where pose estimation models are not just technically proficient but can also help improve human movement analysis and human health outcomes.
