Accurate motion forecasting is essential for autonomous vehicles to anticipate the future movements of pedestrians, vehicles, and traffic signals. Traditionally, this task has been tackled using end-to-end deep learning models that jointly detect objects from sensor data and predict their future trajectories. However, these unified approaches have limitations, as revealed by a recent study.

In this study, researchers propose a modular approach that separates detection, tracking, and forecasting components, training each module individually on curated data. By integrating these modules through consecutive finetuning steps, the researchers mitigate compounding errors that can arise in end-to-end systems.

The key findings of this study show that the modular paradigm, combined with specialized finetuning strategies, significantly improves performance on an autonomous driving forecasting benchmark. The researchers' solution ranked first in the Argoverse 2 End-to-End Forecasting Challenge, outperforming the previous year's winner by a remarkable 17.1 points.

This outstanding forecasting accuracy can be attributed to the modular approach's ability to leverage large datasets for pretraining each component, and then adapt the forecasting module to handle imperfections from the earlier detection and tracking stages. Additionally, post-processing steps were implemented to ensure accurate predictions for static objects.

The study's findings confirm the superiority of modular approaches in the end-to-end forecasting task, and their capacity to handle detection and tracking imperfections. While end-to-end approaches offer efficiency, this study demonstrates the benefits of modular pipelines for tackling the complex task of motion forecasting in autonomous driving scenarios.

In conclusion, this research presents a significant advancement in AI for autonomous vehicles, paving the way for safer and more reliable self-driving systems by accurately anticipating the movements of surrounding agents on the road. Future work may explore refining end-to-end training methods or extending the system to operate without relying on map information. (250 words)
