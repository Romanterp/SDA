Scholarly Document Analysis 

Introduction

This project utilizes Hugging Face's Transformers library to generate summaries for articles using different settings and compares these generated summaries to reference summaries using BERTScore. The goal is to determine which setting produces summaries that are most similar to highly-ranked summaries.
Features:

    Summary Generation: Generate summaries for articles using different settings.
    Summary Comparison: Compare generated summaries to reference summaries using BERTScore.
    Rank Evaluation: Evaluate and rank the performance of different summary generation settings.

The evaluation script will output the average BERTScores for each setting and rank in a table format.
