Optimal transport (OT) has revolutionized machine learning by providing tools to align datasets effectively. Researchers have developed entropic OT (EOT) solvers to tackle the Kantorovitch problem of finding optimal couplings between large point clouds, or the Monge problem of learning vector-valued maps to transport one distribution to another. However, these solvers are challenging to tune due to the entropic regularization strength ε, which impacts various performance metrics.

This study proposes PROGOT, a new class of EOT solvers that can estimate both optimal transport plans and maps. PROGOT takes inspiration from dynamic OT formulations, dividing the mass displacement into time-discretized steps and using EOT with scheduled parameters to conquer each step. The researchers demonstrate that PROGOT is a faster and more robust alternative to existing EOT solvers for computing couplings and maps at large scales, even outperforming neural network-based approaches.

The introduction highlights the importance of aligning datasets or learning mapping functions in various scientific domains, such as biology, astronomy, and quantum chemistry. EOT solvers, particularly those based on Sinkhorn's algorithm, have been widely adopted in machine learning applications due to their computational and statistical properties. However, choosing the appropriate regularization term (ε) remains a significant challenge, as it impacts the algorithm's convergence, bias, and generalization.

In the conclusion, the authors emphasize that PROGOT aims to provide a solution to the ε regularization problem faced by existing EOT solvers. By incorporating dynamic and progressive elements, PROGOT can self-correct and schedule ε based on the target distribution's dispersion. Additionally, PROGOT performs at least as efficiently as Sinkhorn's algorithm for computing couplings and provides a reliable out-of-the-box OT map estimator with a non-asymptotic convergence guarantee. The researchers believe PROGOT can serve as a strong baseline for estimating Monge maps in various applications.
